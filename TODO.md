# Head
- [ ] Spend some time working out the hair.

## Mask
- [ ] Simulated Gravity on the "dangling" parts on the "mask_fox_on" & "mask_fox_off" models.

## Ears
- [ ] Ears droop as the user's percentage of health gets lower.
- [ ] Maybe when wearing a helment, the ears are forced into lower position. So that we don't have a problem with cliping.


# Body

## Tail
- [ ] Tail drops as the user gets hungrier. At 3 or less hungry points, tail is dragging on the ground.
- [ ] When sitting, the tail will be proped up like how it show on Hiktsu's live model whilst streaming.
## Jacket
- [ ] In colder biomes, the jacket closes.
- [ ] In hotter biomes, the jacket is removed.
- [ ] \(maybe) In the Nether, the jacket is removed and the turtle neck is replaced with a slimmer shirt.


# Other

## CONFIG
- [ ] For changing how the Avatar deals with certain pieces of different Armor sets when equiped.
- [ ] Whether the ears should be unchanged (default), forced into a lower position (default for Vanllia Armors' Helments), or be disabled.
- [ ] Ability to control Mask state.
